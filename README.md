## RIASSUNTO
Personal project to speed up the combat phase of World of Warcraft's tabletop game.

For now the implemented functions are rolling the dice and selecting some to be rolled again in the Extra Roll phase.

The results of the rolls are in descending order.

Dice are 8 faced.

## TODO:
- Calculate damages based on the _Threat_ and the _Attack_ values of the Opponent
- Add _Health_ and _Energy_ management for the Player and the Opponent
- Manage battles with >1 Player
- Opponent's list with stats and abilities
- List of _Items_ and _Abilities_ of the Players
- Player's character creation and automatic ability's management
- Add a copyright were is specified that if the owners of the rights for World of Warcraft or for it's tabletop game want me to modify or delete this application they are invited to contact me before suing, but there's no need until I add the names and (maybe) the pictures for the various cards. With that said anyone else is free to use this code to do whatever they want with it, but I have no idea why they would even want to copy from here.
