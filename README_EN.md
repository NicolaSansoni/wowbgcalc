## SUMMARY
Personal project to speed up the combat phase of World of Warcraft's tabletop game.

For now the implemented functions are rolling the dice and selecting some to be rolled again in the Extra Roll phase.
The results of the rolls are in descending order.
Dice are 8 faced.

Dice glow if they pass the _Threat_ check.

## TODO:
- Calculate damages based on the _Threat_ and the _Attack_ values of the Opponent
- Add _Health_ and _Energy_ management for the Player and the Opponent
- Manage battles with >1 Player
- Opponent's list with stats and abilities
- List of _Items_ and _Abilities_ of the Players
- Player's character creation and automatic ability's management
